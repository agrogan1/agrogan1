- 👋 Hi, I’m @agrogan1, [https://agrogan1.github.io/](https://agrogan1.github.io/)
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 I’m interested in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
- 🌍 With collaborators, I have a new grant to study gender inequality, parenting and child development, using international data:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/).

- 🌱 I’m trying to figure out new ways to share and disseminte the research that my Team does.
