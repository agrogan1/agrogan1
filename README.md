- 👋 Hi, I’m @agrogan1, [https://agrogan1.github.io/](https://agrogan1.github.io/)
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦  I study parenting and child development, most recently using international data, and often using multilevel models. I'm interested in reducing violence against children. I work in both Stata and R, and am trying to get better at Julia.
- 🌍 With collaborators, I have a grant to study gender inequality, parenting and child development, using international data:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/).
- 📈 I do research and teaching with multilevel models in Stata and R, and more recently Julia.
- 📘 I've recently published a book on Multilevel Models: [https://agrogan1.github.io/posts/multilevel-thinking/](https://agrogan1.github.io/posts/multilevel-thinking/)
- 🌱 I’m trying to figure out new ways to share and disseminate the research that my Team does.
