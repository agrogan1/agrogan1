- 👋 Hi, I’m @agrogan1, [https://agrogan1.github.io/](https://agrogan1.github.io/)
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 I’m interested in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
- 🌍 With collaborators, I have a new grant to study gender inequality, parenting and child development, using international data:  [https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/](https://globalfamilies.quarto.pub/global-families-project/).
- 📈 I do research and teaching with multilevel models in Stata and R, and more recently Julia
- 🌱 I’m learning about CART and Random Forests, as well as lasso models.
- 🌱 I am trying to improve my knowledge of causal inference
