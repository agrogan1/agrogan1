- 👋 Hi, I’m @agrogan1, [https://agrogan1.github.io/](https://agrogan1.github.io/)
- 👀 I’m interested in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
- 🌱 I’m learning about CART and Random Forests, as well as lasso models.
- 🌱 I am trying to improve my knowledge of causal inference.
- 📘 I'm have written a draft book about multilevel models with international data: [https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/). This includes a section where I think about causal inference: [https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/longitudinal.html#causality](https://agrogan1.github.io/multilevel-thinking/longitudinal.html#causality).
- 📝 I have some other notes on causal inference here: [https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/spruce/spruce.html](https://agrogan1.github.io/teaching/spruce/spruce.html)
